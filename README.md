# * This project is discontinued.
> Thanks for all of you guys who used and contributed to this project, because of the feedback from all of you I learn a lot from this project and become a better programmer. I made the choice to stop this project because I don't need this script anymore and can't allocate time for this because its too low priority for me. So, I hope you guys can move on to the better and up-to-date solution out there that can help solve your problem.

> This is the end of my journey on this path, may we meet again in another journey if fate allow. (^_^)
